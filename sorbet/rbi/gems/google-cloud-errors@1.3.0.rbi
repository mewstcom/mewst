# FailedPrecondition indicates operation was rejected because the
# system is not in a state required for the operation's execution.
# For example, directory to be deleted may be non-empty, an rmdir
# operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
#
# A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding
# between FailedPrecondition, Aborted, and Unavailable:
#  (a) Use Unavailable if the client can retry just the failing call.
#  (b) Use Aborted if the client should retry at a higher-level
#      (e.g., restarting a read-modify-write sequence).
#  (c) Use FailedPrecondition if the client should not retry until
#      the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
#      fails because the directory is non-empty, FailedPrecondition
#      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
#      they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
#  (d) Use FailedPrecondition if the client performs conditional
#      REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
#      server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
#      read-modify-write on the same resource.

# InvalidArgument indicates client specified an invalid argument.
# Note that this differs from FailedPrecondition. It indicates arguments
# that are problematic regardless of the state of the system
# (e.g., a malformed file name).
#
# source://google-cloud-errors//lib/google/cloud/errors.rb#250
class Google::Cloud::InvalidArgumentError < ::Google::Cloud::Error; end

# NotFound means some requested entity (e.g., file or directory) was
# not found.
#
# source://google-cloud-errors//lib/google/cloud/errors.rb#265
class Google::Cloud::NotFoundError < ::Google::Cloud::Error; end

# OutOfRange means operation was attempted past the valid range.
# E.g., seeking or reading past end of file.
#
# Unlike InvalidArgument, this error indicates a problem that may
# be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file
# system will generate InvalidArgument if asked to read at an
# offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
# OutOfRange if asked to read from an offset past the current
# file size.
#
# There is a fair bit of overlap between FailedPrecondition and
# OutOfRange.  We recommend using OutOfRange (the more specific
# error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
# a space can easily look for an OutOfRange error to detect when
# they are done.
