# Mewst Development Guide

> English | [日本語](./CLAUDE.ja.md)

This file provides guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Overview

Mewst is a microblogging service.
Users can create short posts, and following other users displays their posts in a chronological timeline.

## Project Structure

This repository manages two subprojects—the Go version and the Rails version—as a monorepo.

```
/workspace/
├── go/                  # Go version implementation (features being migrated gradually)
├── rails/               # Rails version implementation (existing production system)
├── caddy/               # Reverse proxy configuration
├── docs/                # Mewst-specific documentation (ADRs, work plans, etc.)
├── .github/             # Shared CI/CD configuration

## Rails to Go Migration

A project to gradually reimplement the existing Rails Mewst in Go is currently underway.

### Migration Strategy

- **Use the existing DB as-is**: Share the PostgreSQL database managed on the Rails side
- **Gradual migration**: Rails and Go share the same DB and session store, and features are migrated incrementally
- **Data migrations are run from the Go side**: Use the migration mechanism set up on the Go side (dbmate)
- **Continued use of shared infrastructure**: Shared infrastructure such as PostgreSQL continues to be used after the Go version takes over
- **Do not modify the Rails source code**: When a feature needs to be added or changed, migrate it to Go first rather than touching the Rails side
  - The following cases fall outside this principle, and a minimal-diff fix on the Rails side is acceptable:
    - Minimal maintenance changes required to follow up on a dependency's security fix (e.g., adapting to breaking changes from a gem major upgrade)
    - When deleting Rails-side processing that has become unused after migrating the feature to Go
    - Minimal fixes made in response to an error reported by production error monitoring such as Sentry (e.g., suppressing a 500 caused by an unhandled exception)

When implementing the Go version, refer to the Rails code to understand the existing specifications.

## Feature Flag-Based Development

Mewst uses **feature flags** rather than feature branches to control feature visibility. Pre-release features are developed with the flag off, and the flag is flipped to release them once they are ready for production.

## Development Workflow

### Implementation Guidelines

**Consistency with existing code**:

Before implementing, check whether the codebase already contains similar processing.
If similar processing exists, follow that pattern to maintain consistency across the codebase.

### Post-Implementation Checks

Before reporting work as complete, always verify the following:

- Code formatting
- Linting
- Tests

The commands to run are managed in `Makefile`.
See [Makefile](./Makefile), [go/Makefile](./go/Makefile), and [rails/Makefile](./rails/Makefile).

## Documentation

Design decisions—the chosen approach, its background, and the alternatives that were rejected—are recorded as ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) under `docs/private/adr/`. To understand the current state of the system, read the code and tests rather than a separate spec document.

## Language and Writing Conventions

- **Canonical version is English; authoring workflow is Japanese-first**: The English version is the official authoritative source. Author by writing Japanese first, then translate to English (Claude Code assists). After translation, also review the English version to catch meaning drift and unnatural wording. When a discrepancy arises, the English version takes precedence
- **Code comments**: English block → blank line → Japanese block prefixed with `[Ja]`. Short comments can be one-line pairs like `# Returns ... / [Ja] ... を返す`
- **Markdown documents**: Maintain `xxx.md` (English, canonical) and `xxx.ja.md` (Japanese translation) in parallel. Both files carry a `<!-- last_synced: YYYY-MM-DD -->` HTML comment on the first line; keep the dates aligned
- **Commit messages**: English title + English body + blank line + Japanese body prefixed with `[Ja]`. Do not preserve a Japanese title (prioritize English scannability of `git log --oneline`)
- **Identifiers**: Type, function, and variable names are English only
- **Update both sides in the same commit**: Prevents translation drift
- **Existing code**: Apply this rule to new writing. Migrate existing monolingual code to bilingual when editing it (no bulk migration required)
